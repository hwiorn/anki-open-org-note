1) Install [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1094177960][this plugin]].
   -  Please copy and paste =1094177960= into your Anki 2.1.
2) Change your default =org-directory= path(=~/org=) in the =open-org-note= plugin.
   - Go to =tools= menu -> Click =Add-ons= -> Select =Open Org Note= -> Click the
     =Config= Button.
   - Multiple org-directories are supported.
3) Make your anki-card using [[https://github.com/eyeinsky/org-anki/][org-anki]] or [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][anki-editor]].
   - This plugin handle cards only which are generated from =org= files using Emacs.
   - Make sure your Emacs server must be running. e.g. =M-x server-start=
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (unless (server-running-p)
     (server-start))
   #+end_src

4) When you are on =Review= or =Deck-Browser=, click the =Open Note= button or Press
   =Ctrl+O= key.
   - You can change the =Ctrl+O= shortcut in the config window.
   - This plugin will search =card id= through your org files entirely. If you
     have [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] program in your system, this searching will much faster.
* TODOs
- [x] Implement a initial anki plugin.
- [x] Support [[https://github.com/vascoferreira25/org-mode-incremental-reading][the org-mode-incremental-reading]]
  - =org-anki= and =anki-editor= use the tree structure for card design. But
    =org-mode-incremental-reading= adds a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html][property drawer]] for the card design to
    handle the long text such as book and article sytles.
- [ ] Support markdown files for obsidian and logseq.
